//! A server that a window started ends when no window is left (the lease).
//!
//! Pattern: RAII / Guard (the lock lives as long as the `File` that `hold` returns) with an Observer thread (`watch`) — a window holds
//! a *shared* lock on `<socket>.lease` for as long as it lives (the system lets go when the process ends, also if it
//! crashes); the server it started tries to take the *exclusive* lock from time to time and ends itself, with a clean
//! shutdown, when it gets it a few times in a row. Several windows share one server: it ends with the last. A server
//! started by hand (`serve` without `--lease`) never ends by itself.
